## Setup

## Limitations
Since this module uses a free API endpoint, some requests might be rejected due to high demand, just wait a bit and try again. As an alternative, you can use your private API key to communicate directly with OpenAI's API.

## Usage
After installing and enabling the module, you will find a new button on top of the Actors tab.
